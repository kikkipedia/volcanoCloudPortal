- [x] Add three placeholder functions: type1_eruption, type2_eruption, type3_eruption in eruption.js. Each should log the eruption type and call shakeCamera.
- [x] Add determineEruptionType function that checks current parameter values (temperature, gasDensity, volcanoStretch) against the defined ranges and calls the appropriate type function.
- [x] Update the event listener for 'trigger-eruption-btn' to call determineEruptionType instead of directly calling shakeCamera.
