# TODO: Smooth Medium-to-High Temperature Smoke Transition

## Tasks
- [ ] Interpolate lifetime multiplier from 1.0 at 66 to 3.0 at 100 for smooth medium-high transition
- [ ] Interpolate vertical force from 0.375 at 66 to 0.5 at 100 for taller high-temperature column
- [ ] Test smoke behavior with different temperature values
- [ ] Verify smooth transition visually
